# Machine Learning Project: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Overview

Welcome to the **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** tutorial! ðŸŽ‰

In this project, we'll explore how SVM works, with a special focus on **kernels** and how they impact the classification performance of SVM models. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, but you'll also get into some interesting details for deeper insights into the SVM algorithm.

### What Youâ€™ll Learn:
- The fundamentals of **Support Vector Machines** (SVM) and their applications in machine learning.
- The different types of **kernels** (like linear, polynomial, and RBF) and their effect on SVM performance.
- Practical code demonstrations using Python and **scikit-learn**.
- How to visualize the decision boundaries and evaluate model performance.
