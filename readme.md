Machine Learning Project: Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Overview
Welcome to my tutorial on Support Vector Machines (SVM)! In this project, we’ll dive into how SVM works, with a special focus on different types of kernels and how they affect the performance of classification models. Whether you’re a beginner or just looking to understand SVM in more depth, this tutorial has something for you.

What You’ll Learn:
The core concepts of Support Vector Machines and how they’re used for classification.

How different kernels (like linear, polynomial, and RBF) influence model performance.

Practical code examples and visualizations to see how SVM works in action.

How to apply SVM to real datasets.

What’s in This Repo?
This repository contains everything you’ll need to follow along with the tutorial and understand SVM:

Tutorial Video:
A short, <10-minute video that walks you through the core concepts of SVM, explaining how it works and demonstrating code.

Tutorial PowerPoint:
A slide deck that summarizes the key points from the video for a more visual and structured learning experience.

Transcript File:
If you prefer reading, the transcript of the video is available for reference.

Jupyter Notebook:
The heart of the tutorial! Here, I’ve included the Python code that demonstrates how to implement SVM with different kernels, visualize decision boundaries, and evaluate the model. Feel free to explore and experiment with the code.

How to Get Started
To follow the tutorial and run the code, here’s what you need to do:

Clone the Repository: Start by cloning the repo to your local machine:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/Foxtrot123-png/Machine-Learning-Project.git
Install Dependencies: Install the required Python libraries (like scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas, etc.). You can do this by running:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook: Open the Jupyter Notebook file (SVM_Tutorial.ipynb) to see the code in action. The notebook includes:

Loading and processing the data.

Implementing SVM with different kernel functions.

Visualizing decision boundaries and evaluating the model’s performance.

Watch the Tutorial Video: If you prefer watching, you can go through the tutorial video for a step-by-step walkthrough of the key concepts and code.

Check the PowerPoint: The PowerPoint slides provide a nice overview of what we covered in the video. It’s a great way to quickly review the material.

Read the Transcript: If you’d rather read than watch, or you just want to follow along with the video, the transcript is available to give you all the details.
